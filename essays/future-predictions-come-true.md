Growing up in the technology age, I have seen many science fiction movies about the future. Aliens take over the world and end humanity, humans have to live on a spaceship or another planet because Earth is overpolluted, and zombie apocalypses are the most popular topics for sci-fi movies. These movies can be so realistic that they raise a big question: “What would our future look like?” I was asked this question by my teacher after watching the movie “Wall-E” in sixth grade. Many of my peers’ answers consisted of flying cars and robots taking over the world to replace humans. Now looking back, with the drastic growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technologies, all of those predictions have become possible, as society questions the identity and humanity of the future. These predictions sparked my curiosity, as I ask myself: how will technology truly shape the future, and how can I be a part of it?
	
This question led me to three key interests: software engineering, data analysis, and cybersecurity. 
	
My interest in software engineering grew when I realized the importance of building something from nothing, as lines of code can turn into a website that is accessible and usable by everyone. I enjoy discovering new tools while collaborating with others to create a complete program. The process will not only help me improve my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, but also spark my curiosity as I learn to find creative ways to design friendly user interfaces with efficient backend systems. The ability to grow while adapting to new technology keeps me motivated to learn more about this field in technology. I am also interested in data analysis, as nowadays, information plays a key role in making decisions, predicting outcomes through trends, and improving systems. I am curious as well as fascinated to learn how data can be used in a wide variety of fields, such as business, healthcare, environmental, and even law. As much as I am excited about the endless possibilities, I am also aware of the risks as personal information becomes more vulnerable when technologies are more connected to each other. That is why I am also highly interested in cybersecurity, as I want to contribute to a future where people can rely on technology without the constant threat of identity thieves. As technology is slowly becoming a part of society, the need for more secure systems and databases becomes more critical. 
	
Looking back, I believe that my peers’ predictions will come true in the near future, as technology will become a crucial part of humanity. While I am still developing my technical skills, I am highly motivated by the idea of learning, exploring, and using different technologies to improve the quality of life for the community. Software engineering allows me to design accessible and innovative tools for everyone, while data analysis helps reveal hidden patterns and information that could be used to prevent disasters, and lastly, cybersecurity ensures that individuals and businesses to operate confidently and safely in the digital world. Together, software engineering, data analysis, and cybersecurity provide a useful tool to create a better and safer future.
