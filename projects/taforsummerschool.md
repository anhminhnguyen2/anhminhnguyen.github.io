As an assistant for Robotics/STEM class, I helped the teacher with supervising and assisting middle school students with robotics activities and assignments throughout the Summer School Program at Sacred Hearts Academy. The main goal was to create an effective learning environment by supporting the teacher with daily tasks, assisting students with hands-on activities, and helping them engage with the topics. I worked closely with the students during lessons by answering questions and offering my support when assembling and programming the robots, troubleshooting problems, and encouraging them to work together. Outside of class time, I also helped with grading assignments and discussed students’ progress with the teacher, as well as preparing the lessons, organizing, and cleaning up after each class. I ensured students’ engagement throughout the lesson, helping and motivating them to gain more confidence in themselves while deepening their understanding, as well as curiosity for Robotics as well as STEM-related subjects. 
	
Through this experience, I got to strengthen my communication skills, learning how to be more patient, take responsibilities, as well as receive and apply feedback from others. In order to fully help the students with the materials, I had to learn how to break down complex concepts into fun and engaging topics. Teaching also helped me become more patient and understanding towards others, as I learned how to actively listen and understand each student’s questions and concerns. The program also taught me the importance of receiving and understanding feedback so that I can be more open to improving as an individual.
