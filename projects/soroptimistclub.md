As the Vice President of the Soroptimist Club at Sacred Hearts Academy, I had the opportunity to organize various projects for students through volunteer projects and networking events. The main goal of the club is to empower women and girls in the community through education, mentorships, and services. The Soroptimist Club promotes confidence, leadership, empathy, and life skills among high school students by providing them with resources and support throughout their journeys. The board organized many volunteer opportunities for members as well as networking events with other female advocates, professionals, and local leaders. 
  
I worked closely with the club’s supervisor, president, and coordinator to plan inclusive, impactful, and meaningful events for my peers at Sacred Hearts Academy. Volunteering opportunities, such as helping out at Mothers Against Drunk Driving’s annual walk and Hawaii’s Food Bank, allow our members to give back to the community through service while spreading awareness about social issues. These volunteering events not only help students connect to real-world issues, but also encourage them to be more empathetic towards others, becoming better members of their community. Besides volunteering, the board also organized networking events for the school community. “Career Cafe” events allow students to talk and network with the school’s alumni about the career path they are interested in. These lunch sessions gave students a chance to ask questions, seek advice, and learn about the careers they were interested in through people in the industry. By connecting with other women who are creating positive impacts in their fields, members were inspired to explore their own interests and passions while building confidence for their own future. 
 
Through this role, I learned a lot about leadership, time management, and the importance of communication. Being a member of the Soroptimist Club strengthened my beliefs in the importance of community through service and leadership, allowing me to be more involved and create more positive impacts for society. It also taught me that leadership is not simply about directing others on what to do, but also uplifting and supporting them. This role strengthened my teamwork skills and deepened my understanding of empowering others. My work with the Soroptimist Club has not helped me improve as an individual, but become a more empathetic and engaged member of my community.
